<div class="textblock"><p><b>Higher data rate from Force/Torque sensor</b> OWD now requests values from the Force/Torque sensor every CANbus cycle for a data rate of 500Hz. [19-May-2011]</p>
<p><b>New parameters for setting publish rates of OWD topics</b> OWD now has four individual parameters to set the rate of the various topics being published: wam_publish_frequency, hand_publish_frequency, ft_publish_frequency, and tactile_publish_frequency. Each one defaults to 10Hz and can be set up to the upper limit that the particular data type is read from the CANbus (see the documentation for more details).</p>
<p><b>bhd/SetSpeed service</b> OWD now lets you set the speed of the hand joints for subsequent MoveHand commands. It reuses the same service message used for owd/SetSpeed. In the case of the hand, the velocities vector should have four values in units of radians per second (three for the fingers, one for the spread). The default values for the 280 hand are 2.5 for the fingers and 4.3 for the spread. The min_accel_time field in the service message is ignored for the hand. [11-May-2011]</p>
<p><b>Jacobian support added to Plugin interface</b> Two functions have been added to the OWD::Plugin interface to assist with writing trajectories that operate in workspace coordinates. The function OWD::Plugin::Jacobian_times_vector multiplies the Jacobian for the current configuration by the supplied vector in order to transform jointspace values (velocities or torques) into workspace values (linear/angular velocities or forces/torques). The function OWD::Plugin::JacobianTranspose_times_vector helps you go in the other direction (but of course the standard qualifications about using the JacobianTranspose apply). Also, the full transformation matrix of the end-effector frame (link7) is now available as OWD::Plugin::endpoint.</p>
<p><b>SetExtraMass service call added</b> Clients can call the SetExtraMass function to add mass properties to any of the WAM links. This allows for better control when the WAM is picking up a heavy object, for instance. [26-April-2011]</p>
<p><b>OWD Plugins</b> OWD now supports runtime-loadable plugins (r8821). Now you can define custom interfaces and behaviors for OWD without having to modify the core code. This speeds your development time while also making it easier to keep abreast of OWD changes. See the <a class="el" href="plugins.html">OWD Plugins</a> page for more details. [25-Apr-2011]</p>
<p><b>Model 280 Hand now keeps squeezing grasped objects</b> The behavior of the MoveHand service call has been improved for users with a model 280 Hand. Previously, the hand would try to move the fingers to the commanded position, and stop once the fingers stalled or when the end position was reached, whichever came first. This posed a problem when grasping, because if the object shifted while being lifted, the fingers did not close further in order to hold it tight. Starting in revision 8086 of OWD, once the fingers stop moving the first time, OWD will begin reporting their state as "state_done" (value 1), but will turn off the TSTOP flag on the three fingers and reissue the move command with a much lower maximum torque value. This will cause the fingers to keep applying moderate pressure in the same direction as they were moving, and to move when possible, up to the same ending position. The torque value (currently 800ma) has been chosen to be strong enough to keep applying steady pressure but low enough so that the finger motors will not overheat if they are kept in this condition indefinitely. This change affects F1-F3 only; the spread behavior is unchanged. [23-Mar-2011]</p>
<p><b>Corrected finger transforms</b> Some of the transforms that OWD published for the fingers on the 280 hand were incorrect. The code has been rewritten and is now behaving correctly in rev. 8011. Associated with this change is a modification to the origin of the link1.iv file used in OpenRAVE, and the bh_link1.stl file used in RViz. New versions of both files have been checked in to pr/public/data/ormodels/robots/barrett. [17-Mar-2011]</p>
<p><b>Reorganized Tactile messages</b> Tactile data message is now broken into 4 arrays: finger1, finger2, finger3, and palm. This was requested by a user to make it easier to identify particular tactile pads. The arrays are still all sent in a single message (owd_msgs/BHTactile). [15-Mar-2011]</p>
<p><b>Improved WAMState and TrajInfo state values</b> The state values in WAMState and TrajInfo messages have changed slightly in order to make it easier to infer what OWD is currently doing. Instead of having to look at WAMState.state to see that a trajectory is active (state_moving) and then having to examine the TrajInfo.state to see what's going on (running vs. paused), all the motion states are now in WAMState.state. The state names contain the word "traj" if a trajectory is active: uint8 state_free=0 uint8 state_fixed=1 uint8 state_traj_active=2 uint8 state_traj_stalled=3 uint8 state_traj_paused=4 uint8 state_inactive=25 The TrajInfo.state will now contain minimal information as to whether the trajectory is pending, active, done, or aborted. Some of the previous state names have been deprecated and will be removed in a future release. [15-Mar-2011]</p>
<p><b>Improved routine for saving calibration values</b> The calibration routine has been changed so that after the arm is returned to home with grav-comp on, OWD waits for &lt;return&gt; and then turns the motors off so that the user can readjust the home position before pressing shift-idle. This helps to avoid the sudden relaxation of the arm that can throw off the saved home position values. [15-Mar-2011]</p>
<p><b>Support for 280 Tactile Sensors</b> Can now read the full 96-cell Tactile data from a model 280 Hand. Along the way made many improvements in the CANbus communication code in order to handle multiple simultaneous requests on the bus. [23-Feb-2011]</p>
<p><b>Method to lock individual joints</b> The joint hold functionality present in calibration mode has been extended to regular operating mode, and can be utilized with the SetJointStiffness service call. [23-Feb-2011]</p>
<p><b>Faster stops when palm touches goal</b><br/>
 Trajectories can now be automatically paused by inputs sensed by the wrist-mounted force/torque sensor. The result is a much faster stop with less force applied than when relying on the error torques. Currently the stop condition is a Z-force of less than -3N, but in the future this will be configurable by ROS parameters for both the hand frame and the workspace frame. To use this functionality, tare the sensor before the beginning of the trajectory, and then call the AddTrajectory service with a trajectory that has the HoldOnForceInput flag set to true. [11-Feb-2011]</p>
<p><b>More robust CANbus communication</b><br/>
 In light of ongoing difficulties with the Peak CANbus card, some critical startup parts of the code are now wrapped in retry blocks, and timeout thresholds have been extended. [04-Feb-2011]</p>
<p><b>Better finger movements</b><br/>
 Finger gains have been tuned for better performance. [03-Feb-2011]</p>
<p><b>Force/Torque sensor support</b><br/>
 Data from the force/torque sensor is now read by owd and published as type geometry_msgs/Wrench on topic owd/forcetorque. The sensor can be tared by calling the service owd/ft_tare. [17-Dec-2010]</p>
