<h1><a class="anchor" id="downloading"></a>
Downloading</h1>
<p>The OWD ROS package, and its owd_msgs dependency, can be obtained via svn from </p>
<pre class="fragment">https://svn.personalrobotics.ri.cmu.edu/public/latest/owd
https://svn.personalrobotics.ri.cmu.edu/public/latest/owd_msgs
</pre><h1><a class="anchor" id="dependencies"></a>
Dependencies</h1>
<p>OWD requires either a Peak or an ESD CanBUS card. The Peak IPEH-002066 (single channel) or IPEH-002067 (dual channel) card is recommended for desktop systems running Xenomai, while the Peak IPEH-002093 performs well on laptops if Xenomai is not required.</p>
<p>The Peak Linux driver can be obtained from <b><a href="http://www.peak-system.com/fileadmin/media/linux/files/peak-linux-driver-7.7.tar.gz">http://www.peak-system.com/fileadmin/media/linux/files/peak-linux-driver-7.7.tar.gz</a></b> More information about this driver, along with other versions, can be found at <b><a href="http://www.peak-system.com/fileadmin/media/linux/index.htm">http://www.peak-system.com/fileadmin/media/linux/index.htm</a></b> </p>
<p>Build it as follows: </p>
<pre class="fragment">  sudo apt-get install libpopt-dev
  make NET=NO RT=NO_RT
  sudo make install
  sudo modprobe pcan
</pre><p> (if you are trying to build the RT version of OWD, substitute RT=XENOMAI in place of RT=NO_RT)</p>
<p>The remaining system dependencies can be installed using rosdep once you have owd in your ROS_PACKAGE_PATH: </p>
<pre class="fragment">rosdep install owd
</pre><h1><a class="anchor" id="building"></a>
Building</h1>
<p>Make sure you have both the owd and owd_msgs directories in your ROS_PACKAGE_PATH, and then build owd using rosmake: </p>
<pre class="fragment">rosmake owd
</pre><p>Seven executables will be created:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>owd</b> Driver for arm only</li>
<li><b>owdrt</b> Driver for arm running under Xenomai RT</li>
<li><b>owdbhd</b> Driver for arm plus 280 Hand</li>
<li><b>owdbhdrt</b> Driver for arm plus 280 Hand (Xenomai)</li>
<li><b>canbhd</b> Driver for 280 Hand only</li>
<li><b>canbhdrt</b> Driver for 280 Hand only (Xenomai)</li>
<li><b>owdsim</b> Simulation driver for testing clients offline</li>
</ul>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="configuration"></a>
Configuring</h1>
<p><b>owd.launch</b> is a sample launch file for staring owd using <b>roslaunch</b>. The following parameters are supported:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>~/canbus_number</b> Numeric id of the canbus device, appended to "/dev/pcan" for Peak cards or "/dev/can" for ESD cards.</li>
<li><b>~/hand_type</b> Type of hand installed. Should be one of:<ul>
<li><b>260</b> For a BH260 Hand (serial communication)</li>
<li><b>280</b> For a BH280 Hand (CANbus communication)</li>
<li><b>280+TACT</b> For a BH280 Hand with the fingertip tactile arrays installed</li>
<li><b>none</b> For no hand installed</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>~/forcetorque_sensor</b> Whether the Barrett Force/Torque sensor is installed (<em>true/false</em>)</li>
<li><b>~/calibration_file</b> A string specifying a file to keep on disk of the joint calibration values (see the <a class="el" href="index.html#calibration">Calibration</a> section below)</li>
<li><b>~/home_position</b> A comma-separated list of joint values, in radians, of the configuration of the arm when the encoder values have been lost and the home position needs to be reset.</li>
<li><b>~/tactile_top10</b> If set to <em>true</em> will only report 4-bit values for the 10 ten pressures in each tactile array. Default is <em>false</em> (all values are reported as 12-bit numbers). Setting to <em>true</em> reduces the communication demands on the CAN bus, but does not increase the maximum frequency that the sensors can be read, since most of the time is waiting for the hand pucks to gather the tactile data.</li>
<li><b>~/hold_starting_position</b> If set to <em>true</em> will hold the current position immediately at startup. Defaults to <em>false</em>, in which case it will start up with only gravity compensation leaving the arm free to move.</li>
<li><b>~/slip_joints_on_high_torque</b> If set to <em>true</em> will allow the joints to slip when high motor torques are applied. When a joint torque exceeds the threshold, the joint setpoint is moved to reduce the torque. This option is only valid when in gravity compensation and not during any trajectory executions.</li>
<li><b>~/modified_j1</b> If set to <em>true</em> OWD expects that joint 1 has been remounted at 180 degrees from the original, as is done for Herb's configuration. Defaults to <em>false</em> (factory configuration).</li>
<li><b>~/wam_publish_frequency</b> Rate at which the wamstate and waminternals messages are published, in hertz. Also governs the rate at which a plugin's Publish() function is called. Default is 10, max is 500.</li>
<li><b>~/hand_publish_frequency</b> Rate at which the handstate messages are published, in hertz, if a model 280 hand is installed. Default is 10, max is 40.</li>
<li><b>~/ft_publish_frequency</b> Rate at which the forcetorque messages are published, in hertz. Default is 10, max is 500.</li>
<li><b>~/tactile_publish_frequency</b> Rate at which the tactile messages are published, in hertz. Default is 10, max is 40.</li>
<li><b>~/owd_plugins</b> A comma-separated list of shared library files to be loaded. See the <a class="el" href="plugins.html">OWD Plugins</a> documentation for more info.</li>
<li><b>~/log_controller_data</b> If set to <em>true</em> OWD will create log files of the position, torques, etc in /tmp anytime it is holding position or executing a trajectory. Default is <em>false</em>.</li>
<li><b>~/log_canbus_data</b> If set to <em>true</em> OWD will log all the messages sent and received on the CANbus and dump them to the file candata%%.log in the current directory at the end of the run, where %% is the canbus_number. Defaults to <em>false</em>.</li>
<li><b>~/gravity_vector</b> The vector describing the direction that gravity is acting on the arm, expressed as a string of three comma-separated floating-point numbers in the wam0 frame. Default is "-1,0,0", which is the configuration used on Herb and the Darpa ARM-S arms, with the base mounted vertically so the cables exit down. For a WAM arm mounted horizontally on a tabletop, use "0,0,-1".</li>
<li><b>~/ignore_breakaway_encoders</b> If true, the values of the secondary encoders on an optionally-installed BH280 hand will be ignored and will not be used to detect breakaway (due to hardware issues, many BH280 hands do not have reliable secondary encoder readings). When breakaway detection is disabled the <b>inner_links</b>, <b>outer_links</b>, and <b>breakaway</b> arrays in the WAMState message will be zero length. Defaults to false.</li>
</ul>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="running"></a>
Running</h1>
<p>At this time OWD should be launched on the same machine it will run on, since it requires stdio for startup prompts.</p>
<pre class="fragment">roslaunch owd.launch
</pre><p>No more than one OWD should be started from a single roslaunch file so that the stdio from each remains independent.</p>
<p>If the motor encoder values have not been preserved from a previous run, owd will ask you to first move the hand to a safe space for initialization, and then to move the arm to its home position. You can choose the home position to be something convenient based on how your WAM is mounted, but in general it's good to have as many joints as possible against one of their stops for repeatability. As long as you match the joint angles specified in the <em>home_position</em> ROS parameter, owd be able to successfully set the correct joint angles. For more accurate joint angle calibration, see the <a class="el" href="index.html#calibration">Calibration</a> section for details on preserving calibration values in a file.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="controlling"></a>
Controlling</h1>
<p>The most common way of using OWD is send it jointspace trajectories that define the path of the arm. OWD does not do any self-collision or environment collision checking, so that responsibility lies with the client sending the trajectory. The following ROS Service Calls are supported for manipulating trajectories:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>AddTrajectory:</b> Adds a new joint trajectory to the queue. Options:<ul>
<li>opt_WaitForStart: Initializes the trajectory in the Paused state; you can start the trajectory by calling PauseTrajectory with a value of zero.</li>
<li>opt_CancelOnStall: Aborts the trajectory if the arm stalls (normally OWD will try to resume a stalled trajectory automatically).</li>
<li>opt_CancelOnForceInput: Aborts the trajectory if the force/torque sensor reports a force or torque that exceeds the threshold set by the owd/SetForceInputThreshold service. <dl class="section note"><dt>Note</dt><dd>If the arm is idle (has 0 stiffness), and OWD receives a trajectory, then the stiffness will be set to 1 and the trajectory will be run, as long as the starting point matches. There is no "get stiffness" call. However, the state field in the wamstate message gives an indication of whether stiffness is zero (state_free) or non-zero (state_fixed or one of the trajectory states).</dd></dl>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>PauseTrajectory:</b> Pauses / unpauses the currently-running trajectory</li>
<li><b>DeleteTrajectory:</b> Deletes the specified trajectory from the queue. If the current trajectory is deleted then the arm will stop where it is. Any queued trajectories following the deleted one will also be deleted if their start position does not match the current position (if the current trajectory was deleted) or the end position of the previous trajectory (if a queued trajectory was deleted)</li>
<li><b>CancelAllTrajectories:</b> Always brings the arm to an immediate stop by deleting the current trajectory and all queued trajectories.</li>
<li><b>ReplaceTrajectory:</b> Replaces a queued trajectory with a new one. If the end position changes, then any subsequent trajectories already in the queue will be deleted.</li>
</ul>
<p>A few additional service calls are provided for manipulating OWD:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>SetStiffness:</b> Controls how firmly OWD will try to hold the current position, on a scale from 0 (no holding at all) to 1 (firmly holding). <dl class="section attention"><dt>Attention</dt><dd>Stiffness values between 0 and 1 are still kind of experimental. The stiffness basically just scales back the amount of PID torque being added in. It is not recommended trying to run trajectories with anything other than stiffness 1. However, a stiffness of 0.2 or so may be useful when holding position if you expect people to be interacting with the arm (like taking an object from the closed hand). </dd></dl>
<dl class="section note"><dt>Note</dt><dd>OWD has a feature that lets you "override" the held position of any of the joints by physically moving the arm. Some of them take more force than others, but basically it comes down to the safety torque thresholds set in the WAM::safety_torques_exceeded() function in openwam/WAM.cc. During hold position mode if OWD notices that any of the PID torques exceed their threshold it will "slide" the target position towards the current position until the torques are back under the threshold. Basically, OWD trys to keep from ever exerting a lot of force in order to keep things safe for people nearby, so held positions will yield to force, and trajectories will slow down or stop instead of pushing harder.</dd></dl>
</li>
<li><b>SetSpeed:</b> Sets the max speed of each joint. Note that there are compiled-in joint velocity limits which prevent the speed from being set to an unsafe value.</li>
<li><b>SetExtraMass:</b> Adds the specified mass properties (mass, COG, and inertia) to the specified link, so that OWD can better compensate for a heavy object that is held by the hand or otherwise attached to the arm. When the object is released this call should be repeated with mass and inertia of zero.</li>
<li><b>SetStallSensitivity:</b> Specifies how sensitive OWD is to detecting stalling of the arm while executing trajectories, on a scale of 0 to 1. The PID correction torques for each joint are multiplied by the stall sensitivity before being compared against the safety_torque threshold values. Defaults to 1.0, the most sensitive setting.</li>
<li><b>SetForceInputThreshold:</b> Sets the termination criteria for trajectories having the CancelOnForceInput option set. Takes three arguments:<ul>
<li><b>direction</b> is a unit vector in the force/torque coordinate frame (which is in the same orientation as the hand frame)</li>
<li><b>force</b> is a scalar representing the threshold value, in Newtons</li>
<li><b>torque</b> is a vector of the three torques The values you set will remain set until you change them again. The initial value is (0,0,-1) and 6 (six Newtons of force pressing in towards the palm).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>SetTactileInputThreshold:</b> Sets the termination criteria for trajectories having the CancelOnTactileInput option set. Takes four arguments:<ul>
<li><b>pad_number</b> is the tactile pad that should be watched (1-3 for the three fingers or 4 for the palm)</li>
<li><b>threshold</b> is value that tactile cells will be compared to</li>
<li><b>minimum_cells</b> is the minimum number of cells in a pad that must reach the threshold for a pad to be considered pressed</li>
<li><b>minimum_readings</b> is the number of successive times a pad must register as pressed before the trajectory is stopped</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>GetArmDOF:</b> Returns the number of joints</li>
<li><b>CalibrateJoints:</b> Puts the arm into <b>Calibration Mode</b>, so that the joints can be calibrated using the text interface on stdin/stdout.</li>
<li><b>SetJointOffsets:</b> Adds the specified angles (in radians) to each reported joint value. This service is intended to adjust the arm calibration online based on an external calibration node. If a trajectory is active, the command will fail and return ok set to false. If the SetStiffness value is nonzero, the held position value will also be adjusted by the offset so that the arm does not physically move. The offset will affect everything in OWD, including the gravity compensation torques, so a large sudden offset will cause a jump in torques that will make the arm briefly spasm until the controllers stabilize (to avoid this, apply a large offset by making successive service calls with slowly increasing offset values). Set the joint offsets back to zero to restore the initial calibration values.</li>
</ul>
<p>OWD can also be controlled by sending velocities directly to one or more of the joints. Once again, OWD does not do any collision checking, so the responsiblity lies with the client to avoid sending velocity commands that will crash the arm into things. If the requested velocity is not equal to the current velocity, OWD will (de)accelerate at the maximum acceleration limit for that joint until the velocities match. If a new velocity command is not received for more than 100ms, OWD will bring the arm to a controlled stop (the assumption is that the client has died or given up). Velocity commands should be published to the following topic:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>wamservo</b> (type owd_msgs/Servo): A vector of one or more joint indices followed by a vector of corresponding velocities in radians/sec. Note: joint indices are 1 based.</li>
</ul>
<p>OWD provides feedback through the following ROS topics:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>wamstate:</b> Joint positions, velocities, estimated torques due to external forces, and the state of the trajectory queue</li>
<li><b>waminternals:</b> Joint positions, total joint torques, feedforward torques from the dynamic simulators, and controller PID gain values</li>
<li><b>filtered_forcetorque:</b> A geometry_msgs/Wrench message containing the values from the force/torque sensor after being filtered by a second-order Butterworth lowpass filter with a cutoff frequency of 10hz. This topic is only present if the sensor is installed.</li>
<li><b>forcetorque:</b> The raw unfiltered values from the force/torque sensor (only published if the sensor is installed).</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, OWD publishes a TF frame for every link, defining <b>wam1</b> in terms of <b>wam0</b>, <b>wam2</b> in terms of <b>wam1</b>, etc, all the way up to <b>wam7</b> in terms of <b>wam6</b>.</p>

<h1><a class="anchor" id="barretthand"></a>
Barrett Hand</h1>
<p>OWD has integrated support for controlling a model 280 Barrett Hand attached to the arm. See the <a class="el" href="bhand.html">Barrett Hand</a> page for more information.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="customizing"></a>
Customizing</h1>
<p>OWD allows users to add new features via run-time loadable plugins. See the <a class="el" href="plugins.html">OWD Plugins</a> page for details.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="shutdown"></a>
Shutting down</h1>
<p>To shut down OWD and still preserve the encoder values, first press shift-idle on the pendant, then kill OWD with ctrl-c. As long as the yellow Idle button stays lit, OWD can be restarted without having to return the WAM to the home position.</p>
<p>If the safety board ever shuts down the WAM due to a torque or velocity fault (red error light), the yellow idle button stays lit, meaning the encoder values are still valid. You can resume operation by killing OWD with ctrl-c, pressing shift-idle again to clear the error, and restarting OWD.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="calibration"></a>
Calibration</h1>
<p>To accurately calibrate each of the joints so that their positions can be recalled for future runs, do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>launch owd</li>
<li>make a call to the service <b>/owd/CalibrateJoints</b> to put the driver into calibration mode</li>
<li>OWD will print keyboard instructions and then start a display of joint angles.</li>
<li>Use a bubble level on the WAM links to align each joint<ol type="1">
<li>Start by aligning J1 to be a multiple of 90 degrees.<ul>
<li>If your WAM is mounted with the baseplate horizontal, you'll have to pick where you want the J1 zero orientation. A good location is where the alignment marks line up with one another.</li>
<li>If your WAM is mounted with the baseplate vertical, use a level on the upper arm link, and rotate J1 until the link is either out to one side and level, or straight up and plumb.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>When it's in position, press "1" on the keyboard. OWD will suggest the nearest 90-deg multiple to set it to, and ask you to confirm with "y".</li>
<li>Repeat with the remaining joints, starting with 2 and continuing up to 7.</li>
<li>To aid in aligning the latter joints, OWD allows you to "hold" a joint at a particular angle by pressing "h" and the joint number.<ul>
<li>For example, to align joint 4, first hold joint 2 so that it's horizontal, then put the level on the lower arm and move J4 until it's horizontal, too.</li>
<li>If the joint is with 2 degrees of a multiple of 90, the joint will "snap" to the neared 90 degrees; otherwise, it will be held exactly where it is.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Joints may be unheld by pressing "u" and the joint number.</li>
<li>Because of possible inaccuracies in the transmission ratios, it is recommended that you set each joint near the center of its range, so that any error near the two joint stops is approximately equal.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>When you are satisfied with your new calibration values, press "d" (for "done")<ol type="1">
<li>OWD will ask you to return the WAM to its home position so that the calibration offsets can be recorded. Move it to home, hold it steady, and press shift-idle.</li>
<li>OWD will wait briefly for the position to stabilize, then measure the calibration offsets and write them to the file specified in the launch file.</li>
<li>Once it is done, you can press shift-activate to resume OWD.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>If you want to abort the calibration, press "q" (for "quit") and the calibration routine will exit.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Calibration Details:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The WAM has encoders only on the motors, and the transmissions between the motors and the joints mean that the motor rotates multiple times (between 10 and 42 times) for a single revolution of a joint. The pucks on each motor keep track of both the motor's actual rotor position (14-bit property MECH) and the estimated joint position (22-bit property AP ("absolute position")).</li>
<li>The MECH property value cannot be set; it is the absolute position of the rotor, and only changes when the rotor turns. The AP value can be set to whatever we want, and thereafter it will increment or decrement by the same amount that MECH changes. As the MECH value wraps around, AP keeps going without wrapping (at least when it has been set to a reasonable initial value).</li>
<li>The correct mapping between MECH and AP is unique for each WAM, and is a function of how the encoder and pinion were mounted on the rotor as well as the cable length and tension. But once the mapping between MECH and AP is measured for a particular joint on a particular WAM, it is relatively constant.</li>
<li>The "wam_joint_calibrations" file records the mapping between MECH and AP for each joint, taken at a particular WAM position. The format of the file is: <pre class="fragment">&lt;joint number&gt; = &lt;distance&gt; &lt;MECH&gt;
where distance = AP-MECH
</pre></li>
<li>As long as a WAM joint motor is within half a revolution of of the position that the mapping was recorded, the mapping can be restored by setting AP equal to the current MECH plus the distance in the calibration file. This restores the joint value to the resolution of the precise encoder tick as what it was when last calibrated. The MECH value is recorded in the file so that OWD can be sure of using the right starting position even if we are near the roll-over point for the motor encoder. For example, if the mapping was measured with MECH equal to 4020, and the current MECH is 63, it realizes that it's more likely we've rotated 139 ticks <em>past</em> the original spot (4096 - 4020 + 63) than 3957 ticks <em>before</em> (4020 - 63).</li>
<li>If the calibration file exists, then OWD will use it exclusively, and will not use the home_position values at all. OWD just assumes you have moved the joints to the right position when it asks you to, and once it applies the offsets from the calibration file the right joint values come about automatically. The only time that the home_position values are required is when there is no calibration file at all. In that case, after OWD asks you to move to the home position it will set the joints to be exactly those values.</li>
<li>The right way to start OWD on a new WAM is to set the home_position parameter to the startup configuration you are going to use, and set the wam_joint_calibrations so that it has a valid pathname but points to a file that does not yet exist. The WAM will start up with your home position values and should be reasonably good (it certainly should not velocity-fault because of gravity compensation errors). Once you perform a calibration, the results will be saved to the specified pathname, and thereafter OWD will just use the mapping in the file, ignoring the home_position value.</li>
